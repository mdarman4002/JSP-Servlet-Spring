#Spring Configuration 
This repository contains a basic Spring configuration file, which is used to define the structure and components of a Spring-based application.
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
       xmlns:p="http://www.springframework.org/schema/p"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/context
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context.xsd">

<bean>
</bean>
</beans>

This configuration file defines the necessary namespaces and schema locations for a Spring application. It also includes a single, empty <bean> element, which can be used to define a Spring bean.

#Maven Dependency
This project relies on the Spring Context dependency, which can be added to a Maven project using the following link:

https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework/spring-context

This dependency provides the necessary classes and interfaces for building a Spring-based application. It is a fundamental component of the Spring framework and is required for most Spring-based projects.
